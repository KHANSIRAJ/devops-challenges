Why DevOps & SRE is needed in the application release process ? 

Release process is all about making sure that software updates are rolled out smoothly , without any disruptions.
DevOps and SRE are crucial in the application release process because they enable rapid, reliable deployments by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams, automating repetitive tasks, implementing robust monitoring systems, and ensuring system stability through proactive measures, ultimately leading to faster time-to-market and improved application quality with minimal downtime. 
Key benefits of using DevOps and SRE in application releases:
Increased Automation:
Both practices heavily rely on automation for tasks like code building, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management, reducing manual intervention and potential errors. 
Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD):
DevOps enables a continuous flow of code changes through automated testing and deployment pipelines, facilitating frequent releases with minimal disruption. 
Improved Collaboration:
By breaking down silos between development and operations teams, DevOps promotes better communication and shared responsibility for application stability. 
Proactive Monitoring and Alerting:
SRE emphasizes robust monitoring systems to detect potential issues early, allowing for timely intervention and preventing major outages. 
Reliability and Stability:
SRE practices like defining Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and capacity planning help ensure consistent application performance and reliability. 
Faster Feedback Loop:
DevOps enables rapid feedback through automated testing and monitoring, allowing developers to quickly identify and fix issues. 
Incident Management:
By integrating SRE principles, teams can effectively respond to incidents, minimizing downtime and quickly restoring service. 
How DevOps and SRE work together:
Development Team:
Develops features and code with automation in mind, utilizing CI/CD pipelines. 
Operations Team:
Manages infrastructure, deploys applications, and monitors system health using SRE practices. 
Shared Responsibility:
Both teams collaborate on defining SLOs, conducting post-mortem analysis, and continuously improving the release process.
